# mvc-tech-blog

## Description

The purpose of this assignment was to create a fully functioning front and back-end for a blog style website. Users can create an account, create posts, comment on posts, and edit/delete their own posts and comments. The site is deployed on Heroku and uses JawsDB for the database.

a deployed link is available [here](https://matts-mvc-tech-blog-55706c5c1f41.herokuapp.com/).

This project is not complete - Users can successfuly log in, view posts, and add comments. However, the dashboard functionality is non functioning at this time. 

Additionally, upon implementing the dynamic JS to create the comment fields, the expanded post view has broken. You can see this page by appending `/post/1` to the end of the URL. 

## Usage

The site is deployed on Heroku and can be accessed [here](https://matts-mvc-tech-blog-55706c5c1f41.herokuapp.com/).
